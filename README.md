# my_bot
## Ubuntu 16.04 ROS Kinectic Project
### This project uses Moveit
Urdf model with moving Revolute joints. To run this project: 1.) catkin_make 2.) source devel/setup.bash 3.) roslaunch myrobot5 demo.launch 4.) roslaunch myrobot5 my_launch.launch 

The project uses meshes and the urdf has the correct markup. A better way to do things is to use Solid Works to produce the urdf. I used Blender to create the 3D model with MeshLab to produce the .dae and .stl files.  

The project will eventually use a Point Cloud sensor.
